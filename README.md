# PrivacyHistos

Welcome to the PrivacyHistos repository.  This repo contains five differential privacy functions for combining features into privatized histograms.  The five functions are contained in the **privacy.py** file located in the **src directory**.  In order to use the functions the following input is required:

### Input

1) Formatted Ground Truth Data (ground_truth)
    * All data must be encoded as positive integers with no Nans
    * The column names must be appended as follows:
        - _c â€“ indicates a categorical feature
2) Sensitivity and Epsilon (sensitivity, epsilon)
3) Combination Dictionary (combo_dict)
4) Number Dictionary (num_dict)

### Functions

1) check_input(ground_truth, combo_dict, num_dict)
2) pre_process(ground_truth, combo_dict, num_dict)
3) histo_test(df, combo_dict)
4) create_private_histo(df, column, sample, sample_size, sensitivity, epsilon)
5) col_decoder(num_dict, num_decode, col_decode, value, column)
